![About Me Image](about.svg)

My name is `Ali Bashir` and I'm passionate about `Linux` and `programming`, especially `Java`. I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow in these areas, and I'm excited to share what I know with others.

I'm from Iraq. I'm a self-taught programmer, and I've been working on a variety of projects, including web applications, mobile apps, and games.

I'm also an avid Linux user, and I've been using it for over 3 years. I'm passionate about the open-source community and I'm always looking for ways to contribute.

I'm excited to be a part of this community and I'm looking forward to learning and growing with others.
